My men just found the <color=lime>Legendary Blacksmith</color> in the <color=lime>West Dungeon</color> .
They haven't managed to speak to him, but I know he always wanted to create a weapon.
I believe this means he must be looking for <color=lime>10 Sharp Bones</color>.
You should go to the <color=lime>West Dungeon</color> and obtain a weapon.
