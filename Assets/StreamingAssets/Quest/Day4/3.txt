Well done, <color=blue>spirit</color>!
You managed to obtain <color=lime>3 artifacts</color> in such a short time!
You must be extremely lucky, surely somebody out there wants you to recover your body.
Too bad, though..I never intended to help you with your body!
You even believed me that <color=lime>artifacts</color> could help you!
There's nothing to recover. I'll make it easy for you, though.
DIE!
