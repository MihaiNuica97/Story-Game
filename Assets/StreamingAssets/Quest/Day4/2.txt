It's truly unfortunate the <color=lime>Legendary Blacksmith</color> is leaving town..
Well, you've done good work so far!
Unfortunately, I asked my men to follow you.
They saw you obtain all of the <color=lime>artifacts</color> in the <color=lime>Legendary Blacksmith</color>'s chambers.
Sorry, I can't bring your body back, but I can take all the <color=lime>artifacts</color> for myself!
