The <color=lime>Legendary Blacksmith</color> seems to have moved to the dungeon in the <color=lime>East</color>.
I hear that he's looking to craft an armor out of <color=lime>10 Goblin Skins</color>.
Lucky for you, <color=lime>Goblins</color> can also be found in the <color=lime>East Dungeon</color>!
