Oh? You found me yet again.
{startquest: Weapon Upgrade, Obtain the third artifact,1}
I assume you're here for another <color=lime>artifact</color>
I'm about to leave the area for a while, so I'll make you one more <color=lime>artifact</color>.
All I need is <color=lime>10 Sharp Bones</color>. 
I will make a weapon that <color=red>doubles your damage</color>.

{startQuest: Body recovery, Return to the strange man in town, 1}
{enableUpgrade: Player, Greatsword}
What would you prefer I make, a <color=lime>Greatsword</color> or a <color=lime>Longbow</color>?
