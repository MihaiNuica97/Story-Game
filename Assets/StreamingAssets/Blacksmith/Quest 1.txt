Welcome, Adventurer!
{startquest: Bone Boots, Obtain the first artifact,1}
I am the <color=lime>Legendary Blacksmith</color>!
What are you looking for?
Craft an <color=lime>artifact</color>, you say? Hmm...
Okay, let's do it! I need <color=lime>10 Skeleton Bones</color>.
Ah, you came prepared! Alright, let me create the item for you.

Here, I've made a pair of <color=lime>Bone Boots</color>. When you wear them, you can press <color=red>Left Shift</color> in order to move very fast for a short distance.
Let me also give you a <color=red>Bow</color>. Now, you can press <color=red>Right Click</color> in order to shoot an arrow.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
