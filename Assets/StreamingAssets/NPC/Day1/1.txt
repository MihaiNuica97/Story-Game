Oh? A <color=cyan>spirit<color>?!
Ah, I apologise for my rudeness, we haven't had a <color=cyan>spirit<color> visiting here in ages.
What, you don't know how you got here?
Let me explain a few things.
This town is called Doria. People get sent here mysteriously all the time.
In your case, you must've been sent here right as you were dying. That should be the reason you are missing your body.
What? Recover your body? That should be impossible!
Wait! I just got an idea. There's a legend that says a human can bring a <color=cyan>spirit<color> back to life by using <color=lime>three artifact items<color>.
Artifacts were thought to be long lost, but recently I hear rumours that a <color=lime>Legendary Blacksmith<color> set up shop in one of the <color=red>dungeons<color> around the city.
Creating new artifacts should be no problem for him.
I can help you, but first I need <color=lime>3 artifacts<color>.
Start by going to the dungeon in the <color=lime>North<color>.
{startquest: Rude Awakening, Obtain 6 Skeleton Bones, 6, completed}
Obtain <color=lime>10 Skeleton Bones<color> to be used as crafting materials. Then,find the <color=lime>Legendary Blacksmith<color> and ask him to craft you an <color=lime>artifact<color>.
