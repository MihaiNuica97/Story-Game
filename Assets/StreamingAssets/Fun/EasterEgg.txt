Legend says a spirit got turned to stone when it accepted a quest!
I somehow lost all my quest progress after killing the <color=red>three-head hydra</color>.
I heard there used to be sword that could not slash.
Legend says there was a sword that could hit you twice, regardless of the user.
Legend says there was an arrow taht ruined the entire world.
